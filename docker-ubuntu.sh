## This script is for installing Docker on Ubuntu (Jammy 22.04 (LTS), Impish 21.10, Focal 20.04 (LTS), or Bionic 18.04 (LTS))
## Docker is a containerization software used to create and manage containers. To use docker containers, you must first of all install Docker on your system.
## First, you need to boot up your Ubuntu server and connect remotely to it.
